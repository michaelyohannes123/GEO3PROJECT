# Generating Traffic Accident Visualizations for American Cities and Towns

## Created by Michael Yohannes

This R Shiny application aims to provide car accident visualizations for many cities throughout the United States in an automatically generated manner, such that it can be easily accessed and used for academic purposes. To run this application, open RStudio and input the following commands: 

```{r}
library(shiny)
#runUrl("<the weblink>")
```

## Background 

With traffic accidents being a consistent problem society faces in the modern world, it is necessary for local governments to enact policy initiatives to mitigate the number of accidents in their locality. Having data easily accessible in such a way that one could assess the extent to which certain parts of a locality have more accidents than other areas, could be useful in generating specific local ordinances and policies that pinpoint areas with high number of traffic accidents, and try to reduce that area’s dangerousness in the long term. As a result, I created an RShiny application where a user can get access to dynamically generated maps detailing the spatial distribution of car accidents for areas throughout a given place in the United States. The aim of this project is to streamline traffic accident data visualizations for cities across the United States, such that its ease of accessibility enables future research on the socioeconomic factors behind the traffic accident distributions in American cities. 
Understanding the specific spatial distribution of traffic accidents throughout a place can enable future socioeconomic-driven analysis specific to that place. Broader socioeconomic disparities in society have been shown to influence accident trends. For example, poorer individuals tend to have lower quality vehicles that could result in an increased likelihood of vehicle crashes, compared to the wealthier residents. Researchers found in Montreal that lower income areas had 4.3 times more driving-related injuries than wealthier areas, attributing the disparity to a less adequate road infrastructure in the poorer communities (Morency et al., 2012). Similarly, the city of Minneapolis commissioned a research study on their roads to see the extent to which certain areas were prone to accidents. They found that areas deemed as ACP50, which means that greater than or equal to 50% of an area is composed of minorities, tend to have higher pedestrian crashes per capita compared to non-ACP50 areas in the city (Kimley-Horn and Associates, Inc.). 

## Data Sources and Spatial Scale

The application data was based on [this](https://www.kaggle.com/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents) nationwide dataset of 4.2 million accidents in the United States (from 2016-2020), which was developed by researchers at the Ohio State University. The accident dataset was retrieved over that four year time span through accumulating real time traffic API data. Each accident record has a plethora of attributes, such as start latitude-longitude coordinates (under WGS 84 coordinate system), place of occurrence, time of accident, severity (in relation to traffic impact), and fahrenheit temperature at the time of accident. The accident records can all be downloaded as a large .csv file, which allows me to retrieve specific subsections of the data. It’s important to note that the dataset is meant for non commercial and educational purposes, which is why I also intend to make the application strictly for research purposes, and as such cited the datasets. After finding the dataset from Kaggle, I downloaded it and from there developed this application. 
	There is a discussion to be had regarding the spatial scale, given how throughout this paper I used the word ‘place’ instead of ‘city.’ This is because the analysis scale of this project is at the city or town level, depending on the nature of the place available in the data set. There’s a massive difference in infrastructure between a sprawling urban center like New York City, and a place like Apple Valley, CA, which would be considered to be more so a regular or small town than a city. For the case of making that argument, I define a city to in this case to be a large important urban-centric town. Yet these places mentioned can be searched in the application individually, and have their accidents data be retrieved. The phenomenon that we are assessing in this project and with the dataset used, being accidents, occurs everywhere around the world at any given moment in time, due to the prevalence of vehicles throughout the world. Since the dataset strictly encapsulates accident data in the United States, we can assert the phenomenon scale in the case of this project to be at the scope of the United States.

## Methods Used

I developed the project as an R Shiny application, importing the following libraries: plotly, shinyjs, tmap, sf, tidyverse, mapdeck, and data.table. The initial step was to efficiently read the accidents data set, which was done through fread to account for the dataset being large. Through fluidPage I structured the UI, having the place input at the top for the user to immediately be able to generate visualizations, and have the visualizations output below the inputs. Searching for a place is done through a selectize input on the server-side to enable a faster retrieval of the thousands of cities. Once a place is selected and the retrieve data button is clicked, I use observeEvent to respond to the input place selected. Dividing the input place into name, county, and state components, I filtered the accidents dataset for accidents that occurred in that place, and converted those filtered records into point features through st_as_sf. 
Once the retrieve data button is clicked, I display another input where the user can specify a specific accident record attribute they want to focus on. I decided to have the default selection be general mode, where I just display a tmap mapping out the accident points and also, through mapdeck, create an associated heatmap for the accident points to better show the data’s spatial distribution. Since mapdeck has a Mapbox base map, I also needed to get a Mapbox API key. Responding to a change in input for the data aspect input box, is also done through observeEvent. Specifying options aside results in me applying a color palette vector and modifying it to fit the features of the filtered data. For example, if there were no accidents that have a 5 severity designation, then I would remove the color red from palette options to ensure that red is associated only with the 5 designation relative to the other severity levels. This makes it such that the color designations for the tmap and bar chart color coding is fixed.
I made the bar chart functionality plotly, and displayed this functionality when the temperature, severity, or civil twilight data focus option is selected. For the severity bar chart, I count the number of accident records that fulfill each of the 1-5 severity level categorizations, and have these counts be the number of accidents. For the civil twilight bar chart, I similarly count the number of accident records that meet a specific category, with the categories in this case being the time of day, in terms of the choices “Day” and “Night.” The temperature bar chart differs from the other two, in that I calculated the mean temperatures of accidents in relation to each severity level categorization that an accident falls under. This was done to assess if there’s a correlation between temperature and the severity of an accident in impeding traffic. For example, perhaps accidents of a higher severity occur in more extreme weather relative to the lower severity accidents, with these temperatures perhaps affecting the road and subsequent accident, as well as affecting the accident’s impact. One final aspect of the application’s development worth mentioning is that throughout the application code, I used renderText to discuss relevant tidbits regarding the data, as well as instructions. 

## Results

The dashboard begins with an input asking the user to enter a specific place and select the corresponding option. Let us take New York City as a case study. Upon searching for New York City and then clicking the retrieve data button, you get the following tmap output, depicting the accident points found in New York City from 2016 to 2020, as well as a heatmap of the points distribution:

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics('C:/Users/miket/Downloads/p6cap.png')

knitr::include_graphics('C:/Users/miket/Downloads/p7cap.png')
```

Note that initially general is the data focus selection by default. You can adjust the selection to focus on temperature, accident severity (in regards to traffic impacts), or civil twilight (refers to the time of day of accident in terms of either day or night). Looking at first the temperature aspect, we will get the modification or creation of the following visuals as so:

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics('C:/Users/miket/Downloads/p10cap.png')

knitr::include_graphics('C:/Users/miket/Downloads/p11cap.png')
```

Here we modified tmap by color coding the points in relation to the fahrenheit temperature during the accident, and added the bar chart, displaying the mean temperature during the accident in relation to the accident severity level. If the civil twilight focus was selected instead, we would get the following visuals:

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics('C:/Users/miket/Downloads/p12cap.png')

knitr::include_graphics('C:/Users/miket/Downloads/p9cap.png')
```

Here we again modified tmap by color coding the points, albeit in relation to the accident severity instead. Furthermore, the bar chart instead details the number of accidents that are under each of the severity categorization.

The procedure just described, of selecting 
different data focus modes, aims to work for each place input, and is the main source of user interactivity with this visualization generator application. 

## Discussion

The many possible place options to acquire data from makes it such that analysis can widely vary depending on what one is interested to research in. For example, through this application one could compare the accident distribution for a specific set of cities and conduct analysis on that. Additionally, much of the analysis that is done in explaining the underlying factors behind the spatial distribution of accidents is place specific, as well as the proposed solutions to these accidents in terms of local government and community initiatives. Though, with the application aiming to provide a good sense of the spatial distribution of the data, one could make many associated findings for specific cities in question. This is especially the case for cities with a larger quantity of data, as evident by a place like New York City as we saw.
Adding the bar charts helps account for the points overlap that may make certain cities appear with a higher proportion of a certain data aspect than in actuality. We can see this in cities like Columbus, OH, with severity specified as the data focus: 

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics('C:/Users/miket/Downloads/p3cap.png')
```

We can see that the accidents of a severity 2 appear to be greater in number than accidents of a severity 3, due to the accidents of severity 2 being more spread out throughout the city compared to accidents of severity 3, which appeared more concentrated in certain main central routes in the city. To see the data more clearly, I wrote some test code to split up the data to show only data of one of the severity levels displayed, for severity levels 2 and 3: 

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics('C:/Users/miket/Downloads/p1cap.png')

knitr::include_graphics('C:/Users/miket/Downloads/p2cap.png')
```

The seemingly larger quantity of severity 2 data compared to severity 3 data may initially seem to contradict with the bar chart counts as follows:

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics('C:/Users/miket/Downloads/p4cap.png')
```

As seen through the bar chart the number of severity 3 accidents is greater than severity 2 accidents. This case study of Columbus, OH helps illustrate the usefulness of including the bar chart. Though the severity 2 data is more spread out, the severity 3 data has a greater concentration of clusters that amounted to a greater number of accidents under that category. For understanding the variation between severity level distributions, it is important to remember that accident severity does measure the physical damage caused by an accident on the cars and people, but rather the severity measures the impact of the accident on traffic. As such, it is not necessarily counterintuitive to have more accidents that result in a greater effect on traffic. 

## Conclusion

Given the sheer number of available cities, it is extremely difficult to check for a problematic absence of data that could result in the application running into errors. This results in one having to be more careful to write fairly efficient code to make the application be not too time consuming for the user. Steps can be taken to improve the speed of the code when retrieving the accidents data, as there is a noticeable time duration taken to retrieve larger cities data. This is why I scrapped the idea of letting the user select the data on a year by year basis after numerous attempts, as it led to the application becoming much slower in handling the data of large cities. Perhaps by modifying the code to be more efficient in data retrieval, I could have the tmap point visualization operate as a more interactive year by year timeline. Overall I believe this application has much room for expansion through means such as adding new accident data aspects that the user can focus on, and expanding the current bar chart options. Through these future modifications the application will get closer to fulfilling its intended purpose as being a helpful tool to learn about the spatial distribution of accidents and the data nuances for cities all across the United States, and go beyond the data through extensive research.
